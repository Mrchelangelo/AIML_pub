Repo to store and exchange Code for the activities of AIML Module

Hey fellow students, this is my repo for the AIML module, where I upload the code for each activity I complete. There will be directories for each activity, containing the .py files I used to solve them. When applying search algorithms, I aim to visualise the process as well as implement the algorithm itself.

The algorithms are not written using ChatGPT (or other generative AI) in order to truly understand their functionality. That means some of the code might be inefficient or messy. I’m open to suggestions for improvements or questions about the code. You can reach me on the Discord group chat, my name there is: Mörchen.
